# LangGraph Tutorials & Workflows

This repository contains a collection of step-by-step Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating how to build agentic workflows using **LangGraph**. The projects range from simple deterministic logic to complex LLM-based chains.

## 📂 Project Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **0_test_installation.ipynb** | Verifies the environment setup and library installation. |
| **1_bmi_workflow.ipynb** | A basic deterministic workflow to calculate BMI (State management intro). |
| **2_simple_llm_workflow.ipynb** | Integrating a Large Language Model (Groq/Llama) into a graph node. |
| **3_prompt_chaining.ipynb** | Demonstrates passing outputs from one LLM prompt to the next sequentially. |
| **4_batsman_workflow.ipynb** | A conditional logic workflow (likely decision-making based on stats). |
| **5_UPSC_essay_workflow.ipynb** | An agentic workflow designed to structure and generate long-form essays. |
| **6_quadratic_equation_workflow.ipynb** | Using graph nodes to solve mathematical problems step-by-step. |
| **7_review_reply_workflow.ipynb** | Automating customer service replies based on review sentiment. |
